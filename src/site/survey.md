# Sleep survey

This a survey for collecting sleep data, along with behavioural habits that can affect sleep for the purposes of presenting the data on my [N24 awareness website](https://nightowl286.github.io/n24).

The survey has been organised by [nightowl286](https://github.com/nightowl286/), if you would like to contact me please use the email [nightowl286@protonmail.com](mailto:nightowl286@protonmail.com), or contact me on discord (also under the name `nightowl286`).

## Important remarks

- Please answer in English.

- **Any of the original sleep/additional data that you share will NOT be made publicly available, it will be extracted into a custom format (removing anything personally identifiable that isn't relevant to this study, e.g. age/country information will be kept) and then analysed.**

- If you're filling out the survey by editing the markdown file then please keep your answers in block quotes like so:
	> This is an example answer.

- If any question does not apply to you, then feel free to skip it/leave it blank.

- This survey is for people *with* sleep disorders **and** for people *without* them.

- Including your sleep data is not a strict requirement, but it is ***highly*** appreciated, and it will make up most of the content on the website.

- You're not required to answer every question. If you're not comfortable answering some of the questions, or you're not comfortable disclosing some of the details, then you don't have to. However it is highly appreciated if you can do so. *(If you don't want to disclose a specific detail then please say that instead of fully skipping the question).*

## Data

**As mentioned before, any sleep/additional data that you share will not be made publicly available, it will be extracted into a custom format (removing anything personally identifiable) and then analysed.**

### How to extract your data

Extracting your data will depend on what device you have, and what app you use to manage it, some of the common ones are:

- [Samsung Health](https://www.samsung.com/ae/support/apps-services/how-can-i-retrieve-my-personal-data-from-samsung-health/).
- [Apple Health](https://appletoolbox.com/how-to-export-apple-health-data-from-your-iphone-and-apple-watch/).
- [Oura Ring](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025441594-Export-Share-Your-Oura-Data).
- [Fitbit](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236615?#zippy=%2Chow-do-i-export-my-fitbit-data).


**Some of the export options might also include your personal data, so please remember to check the data before uploading.**

### How to upload your data

You can upload your data anywhere that you want to, as long as it is something that I can access and download from the UK. For example this means you can:

- Upload the data to [Google Drive](https://workspace.google.com/products/drive/).

- Upload the data to a file sharing website like [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/).

- If the file size is under 10MB, you can send it to me directly through [Discord](https://discord.com/), my username is listed at the top of the survey. *(If you do decide to share your data through Discord then please provide your Discord username as the answer to the question below).*

- If the file is is under 25MB, you can email it to me at [nightowl286@protonmail.com](mailto:nightowl286@protonmail.com). *(If you do decide to share your data through email, then please provide your email address as the answer to the question below so that I can link your survey answers with your sleep data).*


---

38. Link  to your sleep data *(or your email/Discord username if that's how you want to share your data)*, please include at least a few months (or years if possible). *This can (and should) be in the raw format that is exported from your sleep tracking device as that will be the easier for me to work with **(but be careful about any left over personal data that you may not want to share)**.*

	> **Answer here**


39. What format is your sleep data in? *(Samsung/Apple/Oura/Fitbit/etc.)*

## Case studies *(For individuals with sleep disorders only)*

The website will contain several case studies for exploring sleep disorders and showing how the same disorders can still vary between individuals, along with showing what they have in common.

***(Not every participant will get their own case study, this will depend on how many individuals want to participate, and the quality and quantity of the sleep data they are able to provide).***

45. Would you be okay with your data and survey answers to be *potentially* shown in an individual case study? *(This would mean your data is singled out and explored for insights, rather than only being used to calculate the trends among all of the participants of the survey).*

	> **Answer here**


46. Please provide any other information that you think would be relevant to your case study.

	> **Answer here**


47. Would you like your case study to be under a specific name, or would you prefer for it to remain anonymous? *(This is separate to question #48).*

## Credit

48. *(Fully optional)* What name would you like to be credited under on the website? *(Please keep it appropriate or I might ignore/modify it).*  If you leave it blank then you'll be counted as an anonymous participant.
