					<p>
						N24 is a shortened form of the 'N24SWD' acronym, which stands for the 'Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder'.
						It is a circadian rhythm disorder in which an individual's day length (awake + asleep time combined) does not add up to 24 hours.

					are 2 other circadian rhythm disorders that
					will also be discussed on this website, and it's very likely that you're already familiar with their less extreme versions.
					<br><br>
					DSPD and ASPD are really just two sides of the same coin. In essence, they mean that your sleep rhythm is shifted.
					DSPD means that your rhythm is delayed (you go to sleep hours later than the average person),
					and ASPD means that your rhythm is advanced (you go to sleep hours earlier than the average person).
					<br><br>
					These two disorders are also commonly associated with being a "night owl", or an "early bird", however the disorders are much more extreme.
					Whereas being a "night owl" is simply a tendency to stay awake later in the night, having DSPD means that you are actually
					incapable of going to sleep any earlier, and you go to sleep as late as 3-5am.
					The same goes for the difference between being an "early bird" and having ASPD, but with being incapable of staying up late,
					and waking up as early as 2-5am.

					TODO: Add chart for comparing DSPD/ASPD/regular wake up and sleep times.
