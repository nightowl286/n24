						This is a website dedicated to raising awareness for N24, and other circadian rhythm disorders.
						There are also some cool <noscript>non-</noscript>interactive graphs further down below,

						<br><br>
						This website has been created by <a href="https://github.com/nightowl286/">Nightowl</a> (me), to
						help spread awareness for N24, as I myself have <i>"most likely"</i> had it since I was 10 years old, maybe even earlier, and I <i>(as well as others with N24)</i>
						have suffered from <b>a lot</b> of ignorance surrounding it, with <b>a lot</b> of rude behaviour/assumptions being directed at us,
						even from those who are meant to be there to offer us the support and help we need.
						<br><br>
						<i>I say "most likely" because it is an incredibly difficult and lengthy process to get an official diagnosis for this, which will be discussed lower down.</i>

						<h2>What are circadian rhythms?</h2>
						<a href="#what-are-circadian-rhythms" title="A shareable link to this section of the page.">§</a>
					</div>
					<p>
						Circadian rhythms are natural routines that are meant to repeat roughly every 24 hours.
						They carry out important functions and processes in your body <i>(such as: sleeping and waking times;
							core body temperature; your immune system; hormones; metabolism; cognitive functions; and your body's reaction to stress)</i>,
						and are meant to be aligned to the natural cycle of day and night.
						<br><br>
						The circadian rhythms in your body are controlled by biological clocks that are located in the organs and glands throughout your body,
						however all of those clocks are regulated by a main "master clock" in a part of your brain called the "suprachiasmatic nucleus".
						<br><br>
						This "master clock" however is actually slighter longer than 24 hours (by around 12 to 18 minutes), and it is adjusted through
						environmental cues called "zeitgebers" (which is German for "timekeepers", but English uses the German term). These environmental cues
						consist of things like: light and darkness; your meal times; exercise; social interactions; daily routines; and stress.
						<br><br>
						Read more about <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm">Circadian rhythms</a>.
						<br><br>
						<i>In German the plural for "Zeitgeber" is still "Zeitgeber", but in an English article adding in the "s" suffix makes it sound much more natural.</i>

						N24 is a shortened form of the "N24SWD" acronym, which stands for the "Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder".
						It is a circadian rhythm disorder in which an individual's day length (awake and asleep time combined) does not add up to 24 hours.

					are 2 other circadian rhythm disorders that
					will also be discussed on this website, and it's very likely that you're already familiar with their less extreme versions.
					<br><br>
					DSPD and ASPD are really just two sides of the same coin. In essence, they mean that your sleep rhythm is shifted.
					DSPD means that your rhythm is delayed (you go to sleep hours later than the average person),
					and ASPD means that your rhythm is advanced (you go to sleep hours earlier than the average person).
					<br><br>
					These two disorders are also commonly associated with being a "night owl", or an "early bird", however the disorders are much more extreme.
					Whereas being a "night owl" is simply a tendency to stay awake later in the night, having DSPD means that you are actually
					incapable of going to sleep any earlier, and you go to sleep as late as 3-5am.
					The same goes for the difference between being an "early bird" and having ASPD, but with being incapable of staying up late,
					and waking up as early as 2-5am.

					TODO: Add chart for comparing DSPD/ASPD/regular wake up and sleep times.
