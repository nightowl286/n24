							This website contains a survey for collecting sleep data, along with behavioural habits
							that can affect sleep for the purposes of presenting the data on this website.
						</p>
						<p>
							The collected data will mainly be used for populating the sleep charts on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>
							<i>(more charts will be added once enough interesting data has been collected)</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The survey is both for people <i>with</i> sleep disorders <b>and</b> for people <i>without</i> them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Uploading your sleep data is not required in order to participate in the survey, however it is highly appreciated!
						</p>
						<p>
							There will also be individual <a href="case-studies.html">case studies</a> for exploring sleep disorders and
							showing how the same disorders can still vary between individuals, along with showing what they have in common.
